## Getting Started

### 1) New released! CIoU and Cluster-NMS into YOLACT (See [YOLACT](https://github.com/Zzh-tju/CIoU#YOLACT))

Please take a look at `ciou` function of [layers/modules/multibox_loss.py](layers/modules/multibox_loss.py) for our CIoU loss implementation in PyTorch.

And [layers/functions/detection.py](layers/functions/detection.py) for our Cluster-NMS implementation in PyTorch.

### 2) DIoU and CIoU losses into Detection Algorithms
DIoU and CIoU losses are incorporated into state-of-the-art detection algorithms, including YOLO v3, SSD and Faster R-CNN. 
The details of implementation and comparison can be respectively found in the following links. 

1. YOLO v3 [https://github.com/Zzh-tju/DIoU-darknet](https://github.com/Zzh-tju/DIoU-darknet)

2. SSD [https://github.com/Zzh-tju/DIoU-SSD-pytorch](https://github.com/Zzh-tju/DIoU-SSD-pytorch)

3. Faster R-CNN [https://github.com/Zzh-tju/DIoU-pytorch-detectron](https://github.com/Zzh-tju/DIoU-pytorch-detectron)

```

In order to use YOLACT++, make sure you compile the DCNv2 code. (See [Installation](https://github.com/Zzh-tju/CIoU#installation))

# Installation
 - Clone this repository and enter it:
   ```Shell
   git clone https://github.com/dbolya/yolact.git
   cd yolact
   ```
 - Set up the environment using one of the following methods:
   - Using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
     - Run `conda env create -f environment.yml`
   - Manually with pip
     - Set up a Python3 environment (e.g., using virtenv).
     - Install [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) 1.0.1 (or higher) and TorchVision.
     - Install some other packages:
       ```Shell
       # Cython needs to be installed before pycocotools
       pip install cython
       pip install opencv-python pillow pycocotools matplotlib 
       ```
 - If you'd like to train YOLACT, download the COCO dataset and the 2014/2017 annotations. Note that this script will take a while and dump 21gb of files into `./data/coco`.
   ```Shell
   sh data/scripts/COCO.sh
   ```
 - If you'd like to evaluate YOLACT on `test-dev`, download `test-dev` with this script.
   ```Shell
   sh data/scripts/COCO_test.sh
   ```
 - If you want to use YOLACT++, compile deformable convolutional layers (from [DCNv2](https://github.com/CharlesShang/DCNv2/tree/pytorch_1.0)).
   Make sure you have the latest CUDA toolkit installed from [NVidia's Website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).
   ```Shell
   cd external/DCNv2
   python setup.py build develop
   ```

# Evaluation
Here are our YOLACT models (released on April 5th, 2019) along with their FPS on a Titan Xp and mAP on `test-dev`:

| Image Size | Backbone      | FPS  | mAP  | Weights                                                                                                              |  |

To evalute the model, put the corresponding weights file in the `./weights` directory and run one of the following commands. The name of each config is everything before the numbers in the file name (e.g., `yolact_base` for `yolact_base_54_800000.pth`).
## Quantitative Results on COCO
```Shell
# Quantitatively evaluate a trained model on the entire validation set. Make sure you have COCO downloaded as above.
# This should get 29.92 validation mask mAP last time I checked.
python eval.py --trained_model=weights/yolact_base_54_800000.pth

# Output a COCOEval json to submit to the website or to use the run_coco_eval.py script.
# This command will create './results/bbox_detections.json' and './results/mask_detections.json' for detection and instance segmentation respectively.
python eval.py --trained_model=weights/yolact_base_54_800000.pth --output_coco_json
